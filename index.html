                    Hi, I'm Austin. A current student at the <abbr title="University of Adelaide">UofA</abbr>
                    studying a Bachelors of Computer Science expected to graduate end of 2026.
                    I am passionate about Programming and the problem solving side software development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During Highschool I developed a passion for volleyball and have since then played for 
                    Nazareth's B team, Henley Hawks U19 div 5 team, and now attend social volleyball for Adelaide Univerity Volleyball club.
